There are many ways to build React apps and ship for production. 
  - One way is to build React with NodeJS or Java, and 
  - another way is to build the React and serve that static content with NGINX web server. 
  - With Java we have to deal with the server code as well; you need to load ```index.html``` page with java.

In this tutorial project, we will see details and implementation with Java. We will go through step by step with an example.

## Introduction

React is a javascript library for building web apps and it doesnâ€™t load itself in the browser. We need a mechanism which loads the ```index.html``` (single page) of React with all the dependencies (CSS and js files) in the browser. In this case, we are using java as the webserver which loads React assets and accepts any API calls from the React app.
